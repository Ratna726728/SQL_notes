* The Origin of SQL
SQL- STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE
• Relational database Technology:
---> Invented in the 1970's almost 50 years ago.
---> Yet about 70% of datobages in Use in industry are relational
---> Industry spent over $30 billion on relational datal Software (2020)
---> SQL is one of the most in-demand tech skills in the Marketplace
• where did so comes from?
---> Back in 1970s, there was a mathematician. Dr. Edgar working for IBM published a paper describing how relation mathematics could be used to
     store & process business data.
---> Data is stored in TABLES ("relations")
     He comes with an idea that we can store data in tables. Which are relations and those tables can be related to each other by keys that are 
     within the primary & Foreign keys.
---> SQL was initially developed at IBM by Donald Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce based on Codd's ideas.
---> IBM began developing commercial relational database. Software products based on chamberlin & Raymond's work.
    • The system R prototype.
    • System /38, SQL/DS, & DB2, Commertially available 1979, 1981, and 1983 repectively.
---> Relational software, INC. (Now Oracle corporation) leveraged the potential in the concept described by Codd, Chamberlin & Boyce.
---> Developed their own SQL-based RDBMS.
---> June 1979, Relational software introdured one of the First commercially available implementation of SQL Oracle V2 (version 2) for VAX computers.

* The SQL standards

---> SQL is a relatively simple language.
---> SQL is a relatively powerfull language. 
---> SQL developers refers to a SQL "program" as a "query".
---> It is Not a procedural language.
---> All inputs to a SQL query are tables.
---> The output from a query is set another table called the Answer set.
---> Some queries may produce Interim ( temporary) answer set.

* Process of SQL
1. Parse 
2. Binds
3. Executable
4. Optimizer
5. execution plan
