2. May be math.

######### Queries for example and practice #############

i) SELECT last name, firstname, hiredate, currentdate, date_part('month', hiredate)
      FROM "database"."employees"; 

ii) SELECT orderid, unitprice, quantity, Unitprice * Quantity AS "total Value"
       FROM "database"."products";

Function in (i) 
date_part("month', hiredate)

function in (ii)
unitprice * quantity AS "total Value"
where total value is alias of those two merged column.

iii) SELECT lastname, firstname, TO_CHAR(hiredate, 'month') AS "Hire Month"
         FROM "database"."employees";
