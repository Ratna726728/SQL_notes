5) Create a basic table namely TEST_TABLE with 1 field TEST_FIELD as int.
==> CREATE TABLE TEST_TABLE(TEST_FIELD INT);

6) Let us start our journey by creating a 'PROFILE' table for storing the data of the users of our platform. Create a table 
profile with 3 fields ( USERNAME VARCHAR (24), FULL_NAME VARCHAR (72), HEADLINE VARCHAR (72) ).
==>
CREATE TABLE PROFILE(
USERNAME VARCHAR(24),
FULL_NAME VARCHAR(72),
HEADLINE VARCHAR(72)
);

7) Now let us create a table to store the post created by various users. Create a table POST with the 
following fields (ID INT, USERNAME VARCHAR(24), POST_TITLE VARCHAR(72), POST_DESCRIPTION TEXT, DATETIME_CREATED DATETIME, NUMBER_OF_LIKES INT, PHOTO BLOB)
==>
CREATE TABLE POST(
ID INT,
USERNAME VARCHAR(24),
POST_TITLE VARCHAR(72),
POST_DESCRIPTION TEXT,
DATETIME_CREATED TEXT,
NUMBER_OF_LIKES INT,
PHOTO BLOB
);

8) We were trying to add a `COMMENT` table to store the user comments on various posts. But we noobs were unable to do it,
can you check our query and help us in solving the error here:
Query: CREATE TABLE COMMENTS (
USERNAME VARCHAR(24),
COMMENT_TEXT TEXT,
POST_ID INT;
);
Error: near line 1: near ";": syntax error
Error: near line 5: near ")": syntax error
==>
CREATE TABLE COMMENTS (
USERNAME VARCHAR(24),
COMMENT_TEXT TEXT,
POST_ID INT
);

9) Now that you are acquainted with a basic MySQL syntax so we need not the table `test_table`
created in the first level. Delete the table `test_table`.
==>
DROP TABLE TEST_TABLE;

10) Assuming that the database is SQLite, how can we list down all the tables present in the selected database?
==>
.tables

11) There are times when you are clueless about what fields a table consist of. Assuming SQLite,
write how will you see the description of the table `post`.
==>
pragma table_info('post')

12)Since in the profile table, username must be unique. How to create a table `PROFILE` with 3
fields (USERNAME VARCHAR (24), FULL_NAME (72), HEADLINE VARCHAR (72)) where the username should always be unique
==>
CREATE TABLE PROFILE(
USERNAME VARCHAR(24) UNIQUE,
FULL_NAME VARCHAR(72),
HEADLINE VARCHAR(72)
);

13) In the `PROFILE` table the full name must not be null. So create a table `PROFILE` where username is unique 
and fullname is not null having 3 fields (USERNAME VARCHAR (24), FULL_NAME (72), HEADLINE VARCHAR (72)).
==>
CREATE TABLE PROFILE(
USERNAME VARCHAR(24) UNIQUE,
FULL_NAME VARCHAR(72) NOT NULL, 
HEADLINE VARCHAR(72)
);

14) The `POST` table should contain a field `ID` that can be used as the primary key. So make a table post with id 
as primary key ( ID INT, USERNAME VARCHAR(24), POST_TITLE VARCHAR(72), POST_DESCRIPTION TEXT, DATETIME_CREATED DATETIME, NUMBER_OF_LIKES INT, PHOTO BLOB )
==>
CREATE TABLE POST(
ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
USERNAME VARCHAR(24),
POST_TITLE VARCHAR(72),
POST_DESCRIPTION TEXT,
DATETIME_CREATED DATETIME,
NUMBER_OF_LIKES INT,
PHOTO BLOB
);

15) In the `PROFILE` table with fields (USERNAME VARCHAR(24) NOT NULL, FULL_NAME VARCHAR(72), HEADLINE VARCHAR (72)) the username and full_name both must be unique. 
But while creating a table with this constraint we faced the following error: no such column: NAME . Can you check and rectify the error. Below is the query used.
CREATE TABLE PROFILE(
USERNAME VARCHAR(24),
FULL_NAME VARCHAR(72),
HEADLINE VARCHAR(72),
UNIQUE(USERNAME, NAME )
);
==>
CREATE TABLE PROFILE(
USERNAME VARCHAR(24),
FULL_NAME VARCHAR(72),
HEADLINE VARCHAR(72),
UNIQUE(USERNAME, FULL_NAME )
);

16) We have to write a SQL query that will be used on the signup page of the platform. Let us assume a user is trying to
create an account with the username as `newton`, heading as ‘Brand ambassador @ Newtons School’ and the full name ‘Issac Newton’. 
Write a query to insert this user in our database.
==>
INSERT INTO PROFILE values('newton', 'Brand ambassador @ Newtons School', 'Issac Newton');

17) Let us now write a query to let the user create a post on our platform. Write a query to create an entry into the table `post` with the following
information: `username` is `newton`, `post_title` is `Intro to MYSQL`, `post_description` is `My First Post`. Note: This post does not contain any photo.
==>
INSERT INTO POST ('username', 'post_title', 'post_description') VALUES('newton', 'Intro to MYSQL', 'My First Post');

18) A user was trying to signup on our portal such that the final query generated for his signup was as follows:
INSERT INTO profile (username, full_name, headline) VALUES ('newton', 'Issac Newton', 'Scientist @ USA');
But we were encountering the following error while running this query:
Error: near line 51: UNIQUE constraint failed: profile. username
Can you check and rectify the error?
==>
INSERT INTO profile (username, full_name, headline) VALUES ('newton2', 'Issac Newton', 'Scientist @ USA');
